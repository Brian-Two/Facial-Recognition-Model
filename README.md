# Facial-Recognition-Model
Analyzing Bias in Machine Learning Facial Recognition

• Developed and trained an eigenface model using PCA to classify individuals from a dataset of 3,248 NIST
Mugshots based on racial background and offense history, achieving an accuracy of 82%.
• Leveraged supervised learning through data preprocessing, eigenface mathematics, and a linear support vector
machine to create the model by utilizing Python Scikit-learn, NumPy, & Pandas.
• Identified key variables that lead to bias in supervised Facial Recognition ML models including feature
representation, model parameters, and training techniques.
